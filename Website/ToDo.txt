Access to admin functions via additional menu(s) on right that appear(s) based on role(s) of logged in user (and current page??)   
Lots of admin pages to add. For now just do following as examples:
     Given Course, choose cases to include.
     Import user list (choose course for them to be enrolled in).
Others are:
       Enrol users in offering (from list of registered users)
       Create a scenario definition based on AnimalSim "template folder"
       Create case from available scenario definitions (or existing cases?)
              Edit Text for case
       Add course
       Add offering for course (copy from existing?)

     
On CourseHome, Move CaseList to right?

If multiple people log on as Guest at the same time they will have different ss_ids, but the same ur_id. Need to be careful about how/where to write their server data so it doesn't conflict. Maybe if ur_id=5 (guest) then store the server data in a folder that is determined by ur_id and sessionid. Clean up for Guest, but leave for real users.

User clicks on caseoffering:
     -does the user have a current instance of this caseoffering?
     -if not create usercaseoffering instance (special handling for Guest?)
     -determine progress and load appropriate page
     -dynamically choose page content depending on caseinstances stage (ci_stage).
             Dynamic display of selection parameters specified for Case

Database table caseinstances maps userid_offeringid_caseid to caseinstanceid.
When user chooses a case for an offering, a caseinstance is created (if one doesn't already exist.). The scenario definition is copied into the folder userpop/uname/offeringcode/casecode/caseinstanceid/  where caseinstanceid is the string of the caseinstances.ci_id.

Reset case
When user resets case, they are prompted to save summary (if case completed), or that this will delete current case progress (if case started but not completed). At that stage the summary is saved (if desired by user) and old caseinstancename folder is deleted. The old caseinstance record is made inactive(deleted?) and ci_sumry updated appropriately. A new caseinstancename is generated and a new copy of the scenario definition is made into userpop/uname/offeringcode/casecode/newcaseinstanceid/. 

Summarize case
Method for choosing to retain results of cases
       Option from conclusion page
       Prompt on "Reset case" if case finished
Method for summarising multiple retained cases
       Save user scenario definition file (animsim.ini) and summary file (animsummry.csv) for case with user's name and description of case
       Save in userpop/uname/offeringcode/casecode/summary/<caseinstance>.ini <caseinstance>.csv

Users can have multiple roles for the same enrolment, role with highest permissions takes precedence. Precedence from lowest to highest is Student;Course Designer;Course Administrator;Site Administrator
Can a user access the same enrolment using their different roles or only their highest permissioned one?

A case gets created from available Scenario Definitions. 
The creator of the case is the COWNER. 
The COWNER can assign other users to be CEDITs. 
Cases are available for any OFFEDIT/OFFADMIN to include in their offering. 
If OFFEDIT/OFFADMIN wants to change/edit the case (and they are not the COWNER/CEDIT), then they need to create a new case (based on the old one) and edit that.
