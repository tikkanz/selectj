If user logs in and is only enrolled in one course, then automatically "clicks" on that course.

If multiple people log on as Guest at the same time they need to have different ur_ids otherwise their server data will conficit. Could store the server data in a folder that is determined by ur_id and sessionid. Clean up for Guest, but leave for real users.

Should really use sessionid for cookie and link to ur_id in database to improve security.

Set a variable called GuestID=:5 or similar.

Access to admin functions via additional menu(s) on right that appear(s) based on role(s) of logged in user (and current page??)   
Lots of admin pages to add. For now just do following as examples:
     Given Course, choose cases to include.
     Import user list (choose course for them to be enrolled in).
Others are:
       Enrol users in offering (from list of registered users)
       Create a scenario definition based on AnimalSim "template folder"
       Create case from available scenario definitions (or existing cases?)
              Edit Text for case
       Add course
       Add offering for course (copy from existing?)

     
On CourseHome, Move CaseList to right?
On CaseHome, Need to workout dynamic way to choose page content depending on case status.
             Dynamic display of selection parameters specified for Case

Method for choosing to retain results of cases
Method for summarising multiple retained cases

Login in directly to course as well as case

Database table that maps userid_offeringid_caseid to caseinstanceid/name
When user chooses a case for an offering, a caseinstance is created (if one doesn't already exist.). The scenario definition is copied into the folder userpop/uname/offeringcode/caseinstancename/  where caseinstance name is a "unique" generated string.
When user resets case, they are prompted to save summary (if case completed), or that this will delete current case progress (if case started but not completed). At that stage the summary (what? where?) is saved (if asked) and old caseinstancename folder is deleted. A new caseinstancename is generated and a new copy of the scenario definition is made into userpop/uname/offeringcode/newcaseinstancename/

Break en_rlid out of enrolments and make separate intersection table enrolmentroles between enrolments and roles.
Users can have multiple roles for the same enrolment, role with highest permissions takes precedence. Precedence from lowest to highest is Student;Course Designer;Course Administrator;Site Administrator
When a OFFEDIT/OFFADMIN adds a existing case to their
A case gets created from available Scenario Definitions. The creator of the case is the COWNER. The COWNER can assign other users to be CEDITORs. Cases are available for any CDESIGN/CADMIN to include in their offering. If they want to change/edit the case, then they need to create a new case (based on the old one) and edit that.
