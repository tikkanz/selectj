If user logs in and is only enrolled in one course, then automatically "clicks" on that course.

If multiple people log on as Guest at the same time they need to have different ur_ids otherwise their server data will conficit. Could store the server data in a folder that is determined by ur_id and sessionid. Clean up for Guest, but leave for real users.

Should really use sessionid for cookie and link to ur_id in database to improve security.

Set a variable called GuestID=:5 or similar.

Access to admin functions via additional menu(s) on right that appear(s) based on role(s) of logged in user (and current page??)   
Lots of admin pages to add. For now just do following as examples:
     Given Course, choose cases to include.
     Import user list (choose course for them to be enrolled in).
Others are:
       Enrol users in offering (from list of registered users)
       Create a scenario definition based on AnimalSim "template folder"
       Create case from available scenario definitions (or existing cases?)
              Edit Text for case
       Add course
       Add offering for course (copy from existing?)

     
On CourseHome, Move CaseList to right?
On CaseHome, Do basic css formating for headings.
             Need to workout dynamic way to choose page content depending on case status.
             Dynamic display of selection parameters specified for Case

Method for choosing to retain results of cases
Method for summarising multiple retained cases

Login in directly to course as well as case
